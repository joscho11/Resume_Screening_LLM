In practice, a job posting will have at least a 1000+ people applying, if not more. If a company can automate the hiring process to save money, resources, and time, while still capturing the most qualified candidates for the next step in the hiring process (assumably run by a human recruiter) this would be a worth while investment.\n",

        "The one caveat with this approach analyzing our model's performance. In a scenario such as this, it is critical that the model has extremely few false negatives. As a company looking for the cream of the crop workers, there can not be highly qualified candidates who are slipping through the cracks because our model does not think they are qualified for the position due to poor performance. On the otherhand, false positives are ok to a certain extent. If we get a handful of false positives that is easy enough for our human recruiters to parse through in the next phase of the hiring process. So it is important to keep that in mind when using a LLM for this task.\n",

If our dataset was labeled it would be easy to just see if the results returned from the LLM are as we expect when looking at the labels (accuracy). I am going to attempt to tackle this in a couple different ways which will be explained at the top of the evaulte section of the notebook."

In addition, I put .7 as the temperature because that was what was used in the example on the source, and I liked the wording of the LLMs output, although for something as straightforward as my task, a lower temperature may be more suitable."

This product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g. pools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future). A game changing product being used very broadly at Wellington by our investors and clients since 2007.  Designed and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment for a mission critical product.  Delivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took ownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team. As a result, I have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my manager for more than 10 years in a row.  Built a very strong and resilient team(from 4 team members to over 50) to support huge demand for the products developed by my team. I was responsible to develop,deliver and support multiple mission critical applications in production and I positioned my team well to innovate new quality products as well as support existing products in production.  Led a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-memory design. This product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at Wellington. The new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in production since 2013.  Led a team to successfully build and deliver a transaction processing system(known as unified transaction system) to represent transactions in a unified format to provide rolled up positions,exposure and performance data to meet emerging business requirements.  Due to continued success and huge demand of products built by my team, my team was asked to build a next generation IBOR platform. IBOR is a single source of truth for all investment holdings information, providing consistent, timely, and accurate position and exposure information that helps the front office make investment decisions. The IBOR provides both current and historical operational investment data and is used by many financial firms both in middle office and front office. IBOR is a perfect use case which combines both operational and analytical workloads (aka hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP)). IBOR 2.0 is in production since Sep,2019 in AWS cloud environment using GridGain Ignite in-memory computing platform.  My team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture. As a principal architect on IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly available,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture. IBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and investment performance data using one unified platform. IBOR+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due to very innovative and cutting edge technology. IBOR+ is a foundational data platform to enable tier1 applications to migrate from monolithic architecture to service based architecture.  Designed,developed,implemented and supporting operational historical data store (ODS) application(>60TB) using Oracle Exadata. The ODS maintains historical positions,exposure and performance data. My team also migrated data and built a data pipeline from Oracle to Amazon Redshift to provide faster performance for OLAP and time series analysis.  Designed, developed,implemented fixed income portfolio management tool(FIPMT 4.0) to enable investors to make best investment decisions to return positive alpha for our clients. As a lead database developer, I contributed to solve database slowness problems by tuning complex database queries and improve data modeling to improve overall system performance of the system.  Designed and developed meta-data using yaml to represent complex business rules and application logic. Developed an automated process to update meta-data in yaml format using Python to improve efficiency and time to market.

This product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g. pools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future). A game changing product being used very broadly at Wellington by our investors and clients since 2007.  Designed and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment for a mission critical product.  Delivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took ownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team. As a result, I have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my manager for more than 10 years in a row.  Built a very strong and resilient team(from 4 team members to over 50) to support huge demand for the products developed by my team. I was responsible to develop,deliver and support multiple mission critical applications in production and I positioned my team well to innovate new quality products as well as support existing products in production.  Led a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-memory design. This product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at Wellington. The new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in production since 2013.  Led a team to successfully build and deliver a transaction processing system(known as unified transaction system) to represent transactions in a unified format to provide rolled up positions,exposure and performance data to meet emerging business requirements.  Due to continued success and huge demand of products built by my team, my team was asked to build a next generation IBOR platform. IBOR is a single source of truth for all investment holdings information, providing consistent, timely, and accurate position and exposure information that helps the front office make investment decisions. The IBOR provides both current and historical operational investment data and is used by many financial firms both in middle office and front office. IBOR is a perfect use case which combines both operational and analytical workloads (aka hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP)). IBOR 2.0 is in production since Sep,2019 in AWS cloud environment using GridGain Ignite in-memory computing platform.  My team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture. As a principal architect on IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly available,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture. IBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and investment performance data using one unified platform. IBOR+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due to very innovative and cutting edge technology. IBOR+ is a foundational data platform to enable tier1 applications to migrate from monolithic architecture to service based architecture.  Designed,developed,implemented and supporting operational historical data store (ODS) application(>60TB) using Oracle Exadata. The ODS maintains historical positions,exposure and performance data. My team also migrated data and built a data pipeline from Oracle to Amazon Redshift to provide faster performance for OLAP and time series analysis.  Designed, developed,implemented fixed income portfolio management tool(FIPMT 4.0) to enable investors to make best investment decisions to return positive alpha for our clients.

This product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g. pools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future). A game changing product being used very broadly at Wellington by our investors and clients since 2007.</li> <li> Designed and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment for a mission critical product.</li> <li> Delivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took ownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team. As a result, I have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my manager for more than 10 years in a row.</li> <li> Built a very strong and resilient team(from 4 team members to over 50) to support huge demand for the products developed by my team. I was responsible to develop,deliver and support multiple mission critical applications in production and I positioned my team well to innovate new quality products as well as support existing products in production.</li> <li> Led a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-memory design. This product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at Wellington. The new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in production since 2013.</li> <li> Led a team to successfully build and deliver a transaction processing system(known as unified transaction system) to represent transactions in a unified format to provide rolled up positions,exposure and performance data to meet emerging business requirements.</li> <li> Due to continued success and huge demand of products built by my team, my team was asked to build a next generation IBOR platform. IBOR is a single source of truth for all investment holdings information, providing consistent, timely, and accurate position and exposure information that helps the front office make investment decisions. The IBOR provides both current and historical operational investment data and is used by many financial firms both in middle office and front office. IBOR is a perfect use case which combines both operational and analytical workloads (aka hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP)). IBOR 2.0 is in production since Sep,2019 in AWS cloud environment using GridGain Ignite in-memory computing platform.</li> <li> My team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture. As a principal architect on IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly available,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture. IBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and investment performance data using one unified platform. IBOR+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due to very innovative and cutting edge technology. IBOR+ is a foundational data platform to enable tier1 applications to migrate from monolithic architecture to service based architecture.</li> <li> Designed,developed,implemented and supporting operational historical data store (ODS) application(&gt;60TB) using Oracle Exadata. The ODS maintains historical positions,exposure and performance data. My team also migrated data and built a data pipeline from Oracle to Amazon Redshift to provide faster performance for OLAP and time series analysis.</li> <li> Designed, developed,implemented fixed income portfolio management tool(FIPMT 4.0) to enable investors to make best investment decisions to return positive alpha for our clients. As a lead database developer, I contributed to solve database slowness problems by tuning complex database queries and improve data modeling to improve overall system performance of the system.</li> <li> Designed and developed meta-data using yaml to represent complex business rules and application logic. Developed an automated process to update meta-data in yaml format using Python to improve efficiency and time to market. Integrate metadata with Collibra to show data lineage, data dependency and other related information across multiple applications</li> </ul> </span> </span> </div> </div> <div class=\\\"paragraph\\\" id=\\\"PARAGRAPH_7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cd_2_21921e0c-eb82-a208-0685-035d0fd30956\\\" itemscope=\\\"\\\" itemtype=\\\"https://schema.org/Organization\\\" style=\\\"padding-top:0px;\\\"> <span class=\\\"dates_wrapper\\\"> <span class=\\\"jobdates\\\" format=\\\"%m/%Y\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJSTD2\\\"> 12/2001</span> <span dependency=\\\"JSTD+EDDT\\\">  to </span> <span class=\\\"jobdates\\\" format=\\\"%m/%Y\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdEDDT2\\\"> 01/2003</span> </span> <div class=\\\"singlecolumn\\\"> <span class=\\\"paddedline\\\"> <span class=\\\"jobtitle\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJTIT2\\\"> Senior Software Engineer</span> </span> <span class=\\\"paddedline\\\" itemscope=\\\"\\\" itemtype=\\\"https://schema.org/postalAddress\\\"> <span class=\\\"companyname\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdCOMP2\\\" itemprop=\\\"name\\\"> Company Name</span> <span> <span>  \\uff0d </span> </span> <span class=\\\"joblocation jobcity\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJCIT2\\\" itemprop=\\\"addressLocality\\\"> City</span> <span> , </span> <span class=\\\"joblocation jobstate\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJSTA2\\\" itemprop=\\\"addressRegion\\\"> State</span> <span class=\\\"joblocation jobcountry\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJCNT2\\\"> </span> </span> <span class=\\\"paddedline\\\"> <span class=\\\"jobline\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJDES2\\\" itemprop=\\\"description\\\"> <p> As a senior developer, successfully developed and deployed a Commodity Trading System in production.

I was responsible to develop,deliver and support multiple mission critical applications in production and I positioned my team well to innovate new quality products as well as support existing products in production.  Led a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-memory design. This product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at Wellington. The new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in production since 2013.  Led a team to successfully build and deliver a transaction processing system(known as unified transaction system) to represent transactions in a unified format to provide rolled up positions,exposure and performance data to meet emerging business requirements.  Due to continued success and huge demand of products built by my team, my team was asked to build a next generation IBOR platform. IBOR is a single source of truth for all investment holdings information, providing consistent, timely, and accurate position and exposure information that helps the front office make investment decisions. The IBOR provides both current and historical operational investment data and is used by many financial firms both in middle office and front office. IBOR is a perfect use case which combines both operational and analytical workloads (aka hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP)). IBOR 2.0 is in production since Sep,2019 in AWS cloud environment using GridGain Ignite in-memory computing platform.  My team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture. As a principal architect on IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly available,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture. IBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and investment performance data using one unified platform. IBOR+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due to very innovative and cutting edge technology. IBOR+ is a foundational data platform to enable tier1 applications to migrate from monolithic architecture to service based architecture.  Designed,developed,implemented and supporting operational historical data store (ODS) application(>60TB) using Oracle Exadata. The ODS maintains historical positions,exposure and performance data. My team also migrated data and built a data pipeline from Oracle to Amazon Redshift to provide faster performance for OLAP and time series analysis.  Designed, developed,implemented fixed income portfolio management tool(FIPMT 4.0) to enable investors to make best investment decisions to return positive alpha for our clients. As a lead database developer, I contributed to solve database slowness problems by tuning complex database queries and improve data modeling to improve overall system performance of the system.  Designed and developed meta-data using yaml to represent complex business rules and application logic. Developed an automated process to update meta-data in yaml format using Python to improve efficiency and time to market. Integrate metadata with Collibra to show data lineage, data dependency and other related information across multiple applications         12/2001   to   01/2003     Senior Software Engineer    Company Name    \\uff0d    City  ,   State       As a senior developer, successfully developed and deployed a Commodity Trading System in production. Proactively took ownership and help team resolve a deadlock situation due to a very creative and innovative solution.

This product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g. pools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future). A game changing product being used very broadly at Wellington by our investors and clients since 2007.</li> <li> Designed and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment for a mission critical product.</li> <li> Delivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took ownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team. As a result, I have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my manager for more than 10 years in a row.</li> <li> Built a very strong and resilient team(from 4 team members to over 50) to support huge demand for the products developed by my team. I was responsible to develop,deliver and support multiple mission critical applications in production and I positioned my team well to innovate new quality products as well as support existing products in production.</li> <li> Led a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-memory design. This product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at Wellington. The new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in production since 2013.</li> <li> Led a team to successfully build and deliver a transaction processing system(known as unified transaction system) to represent transactions in a unified format to provide rolled up positions,exposure and performance data to meet emerging business requirements.</li> <li> Due to continued success and huge demand of products built by my team, my team was asked to build a next generation IBOR platform. IBOR is a single source of truth for all investment holdings information, providing consistent, timely, and accurate position and exposure information that helps the front office make investment decisions. The IBOR provides both current and historical operational investment data and is used by many financial firms both in middle office and front office. IBOR is a perfect use case which combines both operational and analytical workloads (aka hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP)). IBOR 2.0 is in production since Sep,2019 in AWS cloud environment using GridGain Ignite in-memory computing platform.</li> <li> My team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture. As a principal architect on IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly available,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture. IBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and investment performance data using one unified platform. IBOR+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due to very innovative and cutting edge technology. IBOR+ is a foundational data platform to enable tier1 applications to migrate from monolithic architecture to service based architecture.</li> <li> Designed,developed,implemented and supporting operational historical data store (ODS) application(&gt;60TB) using Oracle Exadata. The ODS maintains historical positions,exposure and performance data. My team also migrated data and built a data pipeline from Oracle to Amazon Redshift to provide faster performance for OLAP and time series analysis.</li> <li> Designed, developed,implemented fixed income portfolio management tool(FIPMT 4.0) to enable investors to make best investment decisions to return positive alpha for our clients. As a lead database developer, I contributed to solve database slowness problems by tuning complex database queries and improve data modeling to improve overall system performance of the system.</li> <li> Designed and developed meta-data using yaml to represent complex business rules and application logic. Developed an automated process to update meta-data in yaml format using Python to improve efficiency and time to market. Integrate metadata with Collibra to show data lineage, data dependency and other related information across multiple applications</li> </ul> </span> </span> </div> </div> <div class=\\\"paragraph\\\" id=\\\"PARAGRAPH_7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cd_2_21921e0c-eb82-a208-0685-035d0fd30956\\\" itemscope=\\\"\\\" itemtype=\\\"https://schema.org/Organization\\\" style=\\\"padding-top:0px;\\\"> <span class=\\\"dates_wrapper\\\"> <span class=\\\"jobdates\\\" format=\\\"%m/%Y\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJSTD2\\\"> 12/2001</span> <span dependency=\\\"JSTD+EDDT\\\">  to </span> <span class=\\\"jobdates\\\" format=\\\"%m/%Y\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdEDDT2\\\"> 01/2003</span> </span> <div class=\\\"singlecolumn\\\"> <span class=\\\"paddedline\\\"> <span class=\\\"jobtitle\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJTIT2\\\"> Senior Software Engineer</span> </span> <span class=\\\"paddedline\\\" itemscope=\\\"\\\" itemtype=\\\"https://schema.org/postalAddress\\\"> <span class=\\\"companyname\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdCOMP2\\\" itemprop=\\\"name\\\"> Company Name</span> <span> <span>  \\uff0d </span> </span> <span class=\\\"joblocation jobcity\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJCIT2\\\" itemprop=\\\"addressLocality\\\"> City</span> <span> , </span> <span class=\\\"joblocation jobstate\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJSTA2\\\" itemprop=\\\"addressRegion\\\"> State</span> <span class=\\\"joblocation jobcountry\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJCNT2\\\"> </span> </span> <span class=\\\"paddedline\\\"> <span class=\\\"jobline\\\" id=\\\"7ca99354-d8a1-48a1-a94f-d9dc8dae13cdJDES2\\\" itemprop=\\\"description\\\"> <p> As a senior developer, successfully developed and deployed a Commodity Trading System in production.

        "One question I had when doing the evaluation is how useful similarity score would be given that I am retrieving the documents using similarity score. From my understanding, the important distinction is that during retrieval the retriever grabs the highest scored chunks. This could be chunks from the same resume or different resumes. This can cause output from my LLM that may not match similiarity score for entire resumes. This is why I may have output from an unlikely source such as a resume from agriculture or sales. Even if the entire resume may not be a great candidate for the job, a chunk of the resume performed very well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then the model will take our retrieved documents (hopefully from multiple resumes) and do things other than just use a similarity score to justify the output response. For example, summarizing and reasoning could play a role in the response output.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we have the response output of the LLM we can again use similarity score to evalute the output to see if the resume the LLM selected as whole scores highly.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you can see, the resume from an engineer scored the highest which makes sense as that could be resume with very similar textual meaning to the data scientist job posting, while the other two scored decently but not close to resume 51588273. Again, it is important to note this is more than just looking at exact word match, but the semantic similarity between language in the job posting and the resume.\n",
        "\n",
        "Again, context is everything when thinking about LLMs. For our task, lower scores could be acceptable because we want to cast a wide net to make sure no highly qualified candidate slips through the cracks. But at the end of the day, if we missed a candidate because their resume is poorly done to match our job description that is on them. It is also important not to cast too wide a net to keep it managable for a human recruiter to parse through results. So it is a balance. So while the other 2 scores are not ideal based on semantic similarity score, they may still be valuable candidates to look into further for the job posting. The LLM can be more of a baseline to filter our any candidates who are not worth the time to have a human look into.\n",
        "\n",
        "To summarize, just because a resume has a high similarity score to the job posting does not mean they are instantly the best person for the job. It just means they have text in their resume that is similar in meaning to the job. The could have just fabriacted various things to make it look that way. And vice versa for a low score."
